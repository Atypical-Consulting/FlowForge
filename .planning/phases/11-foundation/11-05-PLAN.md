<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>
Phase 11 Foundation implementation:
- Toast notification system with queue, stacking, actions
- Settings window with categories and persistence
- Layout fixes (compact left panel, commit form position, modal for conventional commits)
- Toast wiring to all Git operations
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
Run the app: npm run tauri dev

**Toast Notifications (UI-01, UI-02, UI-03, UI-04):**
1. Open a repository with changes
2. Stage some files and make a commit
3. Verify: Toast appears with commit message and "Push now" button
4. Verify: Toast auto-dismisses after ~5 seconds (progress bar visible)
5. Click X on a toast - verify it dismisses immediately
6. Trigger an error (e.g., push to non-existent remote)
7. Verify: Error toast persists, has Retry button
8. Stack test: Trigger multiple operations quickly, verify max 3 toasts visible

**Settings Window (DFLT-05, DFLT-06):**
1. Click gear icon in header
2. Verify: Settings window opens with sidebar (General, Git, Appearance)
3. Press Ctrl+, (or Cmd+, on Mac)
4. Verify: Settings window opens
5. Change theme in Appearance tab
6. Verify: Theme applies immediately
7. Close app and reopen
8. Verify: Theme setting persisted

**Layout Fixes (LAYOUT-01, LAYOUT-02, LAYOUT-03, DFLT-01):**
1. Look at left panel branches list
2. Verify: Compact spacing, readable text, icons don't overlap
3. Look at commit form
4. Verify: It's at bottom of LEFT panel, not covering middle panel
5. Check "Conventional Commits" checkbox
6. Verify: It was unchecked by default
7. Verify: Clicking shows modal (not inline form)
