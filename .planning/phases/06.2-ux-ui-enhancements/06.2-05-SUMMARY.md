# Plan 06.2-05: Welcome View Redesign

## Execution Summary

**Duration:** ~5 minutes
**Commits:** 1

## Tasks Completed

| # | Task | Commit | Status |
|---|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Create animated gradient background component | 3793eb2 | Done |
| 2 | Integrate gradient and animations into WelcomeView | 3793eb2 | Done |

## Deliverables

- **src/components/welcome/AnimatedGradientBg.tsx** - Animated background with Catppuccin orbs
- **src/components/welcome/index.ts** - Barrel export
- **src/components/WelcomeView.tsx** - Redesigned with animations

## Verification

- [x] npm build succeeds
- [x] Welcome view has animated gradient background
- [x] Content fades in with stagger effect
- [x] Flame icon visible for forge aesthetic
- [x] Drag-and-drop overlay matches new design

## Deviations

None.

## Notes

The animated gradient uses three Catppuccin-colored orbs (blue, mauve, peach) that slowly animate position and scale for a subtle, living background effect. A faint grid overlay adds depth.
