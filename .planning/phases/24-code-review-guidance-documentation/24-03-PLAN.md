    Present the user with verification steps for both UX-03 (review checklist) and UX-04 (documentation website). Run `npm run tauri dev` for checklist verification and `npm run docs:dev` for docs verification. Wait for user approval.

    **What was built:**

    **UX-03 — Review Checklist:**
    - Pre-merge review checklist appears in the FinishFlowDialog when finishing a Gitflow feature, release, or hotfix
    - Checklist items are advisory (never block the Finish button)
    - Default items provided per flow type (feature: 3, release: 4, hotfix: 3)
    - Custom items configurable in Settings > Review tab (add, delete, reset to defaults)
    - Items persist across app restarts via Tauri plugin-store

    **UX-04 — Documentation Website:**
    - VitePress site with Catppuccin Mocha theme
    - Landing page, getting-started guide, feature pages (Gitflow, Staging, Branches), reference pages (Keyboard Shortcuts, Settings)
    - GitHub Actions workflow for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages
  </action>
  <verify>
    **UX-03 Verification (Review Checklist):**
    1. Open a repository with Gitflow initialized
    2. Start a feature branch, make a commit, then click "Finish Feature"
    3. Verify: The FinishFlowDialog shows a "Review checklist" section with 3 default items (All tests pass, No debug statements, Code self-reviewed)
    4. Check some items, leave others unchecked — verify the "Finish" button remains enabled
    5. Click Finish — verify the merge completes normally
    6. Open Settings (Cmd/Ctrl+,) → navigate to "Review" tab
    7. Verify: 3 flow type sections (Feature, Release, Hotfix) with their default items
    8. Add a custom item to the Feature checklist (e.g., "Linting passed")
    9. Close and reopen Settings → verify the custom item persists
    10. Start and finish another feature — verify the custom item appears in the checklist
    11. In Settings > Review, click "Reset to defaults" on Feature — verify defaults are restored

    **UX-04 Verification (Documentation Website):**
    1. Run `npm run docs:dev` in terminal
    2. Open the local dev server URL in a browser
    3. Verify: Landing page shows FlowForge hero with "Get Started" and "View on GitHub" links
    4. Verify: Dark Catppuccin Mocha theme is active (dark background, mauve accents)
    5. Navigate to "Getting Started" — verify installation and first-repo instructions
    6. Navigate to Features > Overview — verify all features listed
    7. Navigate to Features > Gitflow — verify Gitflow workflow guide
    8. Navigate to Reference > Keyboard Shortcuts — verify all 11 shortcuts are listed
    9. Navigate to Reference > Settings — verify all settings categories documented
    10. Verify: `npm run docs:build` completes without errors
    11. Verify: `.github/workflows/docs.yml` exists with correct deployment configuration
  </verify>
  <done>User approves both UX-03 and UX-04 — type "approved" or describe issues found</done>
