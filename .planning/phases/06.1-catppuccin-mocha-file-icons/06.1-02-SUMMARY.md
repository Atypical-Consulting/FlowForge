# Plan 06.1-02 Summary: Integration into FileItem and FileTreeView

## Status: Complete

## What Was Built

Integrated Catppuccin Mocha file type icons into the staging/changes view:

1. **FileItem Component Updates**
   - Replaced Lucide status icons (FilePlus, FileMinus, FileEdit, FileQuestion) with FileTypeIcon
   - Added status dot overlay showing git status via colored indicator:
     - Green = added/new files
     - Yellow = modified files
     - Red = deleted files
     - Blue = untracked files
     - Purple = renamed files
   - Status dot positioned at bottom-right of file icon with border for visibility
   - Cleaned up unused Lucide imports

2. **FileTreeView Component Updates**
   - Replaced Lucide Folder icon with FileTypeIcon
   - Folder icon now changes based on expanded/collapsed state (folder-open vs folder)
   - Cleaned up unused Folder import from lucide-react

## Files Modified

- src/components/staging/FileItem.tsx
  - Added FileTypeIcon import
  - Added getStatusDot helper function
  - Replaced StatusIcon with FileTypeIcon + status dot overlay
  - Removed unused Lucide imports (FilePlus, FileMinus, FileEdit, FileQuestion)

- src/components/staging/FileTreeView.tsx
  - Added FileTypeIcon import
  - Replaced Folder component with FileTypeIcon (isDirectory, isOpen props)
  - Removed unused Folder import from lucide-react

## Verification

- ✓ `npm run build` completes successfully
- ✓ Biome linting passes with no errors
- ✓ TypeScript compiles without errors
- ✓ No unused imports

## Visual Changes

Before:
- Generic Lucide icons (FilePlus/FileMinus/etc.) indicated git status
- Blue Lucide folder icon for directories

After:
- File-type-specific Catppuccin Mocha icons (TypeScript blue, Rust orange, etc.)
- Small colored dot overlay shows git status
- Catppuccin folder icons that change when expanded/collapsed

## Notes

- Status dot uses border-gray-900 to ensure visibility against any background
- Status dot is small (w-2 h-2) to not obscure the file type icon
- Preserved all existing functionality (staging/unstaging, selection, etc.)
