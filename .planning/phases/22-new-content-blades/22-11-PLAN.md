# Human Verification Checkpoint — Phase 22 UAT

## Goal

User acceptance testing for Phase 22. The human verifies all 6 CONTENT requirements are met by performing hands-on testing of each content blade. This plan is NOT autonomous — it requires human interaction.

## must_haves

- All 6 CONTENT requirements pass manual verification
- No regressions in existing blade functionality (staging, topology, commit details, diff, settings, changelog)
- No new TypeScript errors
- No console errors in production build

## Tasks

<task id="1" title="UAT Test Execution">

- Expected: "Drag to orbit | Scroll to zoom | Shift+drag to pan" appears and fades after ~4 seconds.

### CONTENT-04: Repository File Browser

**Test 4.1**: Click "Browse Files" in the header toolbar.
- Expected: Repo browser opens at repository root with files and folders listed.

**Test 4.2**: Verify folders appear before files, both sorted alphabetically.

<task id="2" title="Record Results and Update STATE.md" depends_on="1">

After completing all tests:

1. Record PASS/FAIL for each test in a results table.
2. If all tests pass:
   - Update `.planning/STATE.md` to mark Phase 22 as complete
