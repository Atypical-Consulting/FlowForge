<objective>
Verify all Phase 12 workflows function correctly.

Purpose: Human verification that clone, Gitflow init, and amend features work as expected.
Output: Confirmed working workflows ready for next phase.

Phase 12 Workflows:
1. Clone Repository - Clone by URL with progress, destination picker, auto-open
2. Gitflow Init - Initialize Gitflow on non-Gitflow repos with branch configuration
3. Amend Commit - Pre-fill previous message, confirmation dialog, keyboard shortcut
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
**Clone Workflow:**
1. Start app with no repo open (welcome page)
2. Click "Clone Repository" button
3. Enter a public repo URL (e.g., https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World.git)
4. Click Browse and select a destination folder
5. Click Clone - verify progress shows (receiving, resolving, checkout)
6. Verify: After clone, repository auto-opens
7. Verify: Cloned repo appears in recent repos

**Gitflow Init Workflow:**
1. Open a repository that does NOT have Gitflow (no develop branch)
2. Look in left sidebar - "Initialize Gitflow" button should appear
3. Click it - configuration dialog opens
4. Verify default values: main detected, develop = "develop", prefixes have "/"
5. Click Initialize
6. Verify: develop branch created, switched to develop
7. Verify: Gitflow controls now appear in sidebar instead of init button
8. Check .git/config has [gitflow "branch"] section

**Amend Workflow:**
1. Make a commit with message "Test commit"
2. Stage a small change
3. Check "Amend last commit" checkbox
4. Verify: Previous message "Test commit" loads into textarea
5. Edit the message to "Test commit amended"
6. Click "Amend Commit"
7. Verify: Confirmation dialog appears
8. Confirm - commit is amended
9. Verify: History shows amended commit

**Keyboard Shortcut:**
1. Press Ctrl+Shift+M (or Cmd+Shift+M on Mac)
2. Verify: Amend checkbox toggles
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "verified" if all workflows work correctly, or describe any issues found.</resume-signal>

User confirms all three workflows function correctly.

<success_criteria>
- Clone: URL entry, folder picker, progress display, auto-open after clone
- Gitflow Init: Button appears on non-Gitflow repos, dialog configures branches, creates develop
- Amend: Checkbox loads previous message, confirmation before execute, keyboard shortcut works
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/12-workflows/12-06-SUMMARY.md`
