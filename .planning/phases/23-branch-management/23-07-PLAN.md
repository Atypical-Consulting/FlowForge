<objective>
Human verification of all Phase 23 branch management features.

Purpose: Verify that all 6 requirements (BRANCH-01 through BRANCH-06) work correctly in the running application before marking the phase complete.

Output: Verification pass/fail results for all success criteria.

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>Complete branch management system with 6 features: recent branches, pinning, scope selector, bulk delete, feature-branch purple badges, and contextual clone/reveal button.</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
Start the app with `npm run tauri dev` and open a repository that has multiple branches (including feature/ branches).

**BRANCH-01 — Recent Branches:**
1. Switch between 2-3 branches by clicking them in the branch list
2. Verify a "Recent" section appears below "Quick Access" showing the branches you just visited
3. Verify the recent list is sorted by most-recently-used first
4. Verify the current branch does NOT appear in the recent list

**BRANCH-02 — Pinned Branches:**
5. Hover over a branch in the branch list — verify a pin icon appears
6. Click the pin icon — verify the branch moves to the "Quick Access" section at top
7. Pin another branch — verify both appear in Quick Access
8. Click the pin icon on a pinned branch — verify it is removed from Quick Access
9. Close and reopen the app — verify pinned branches persist

**BRANCH-03 — Scope Selector:**
10. Find the segmented control at the top of the branch list (Local | Remote | Last Used)
11. Click "Remote" — verify only remote branches appear in the main list
12. Click "Last Used" — verify only recently visited branches appear
13. Click "Local" — verify local branches appear (default view)
14. Verify the Quick Access (pinned) section remains visible regardless of scope selection

**BRANCH-04 — Bulk Delete:**
15. Find the "Clean up" button in the branch list area
16. Click it — verify checkboxes appear next to branches
17. Verify main and develop branches have a shield icon (cannot be selected)
18. Select some merged branches — verify the selection count updates
19. Click "Delete" — verify a confirmation dialog appears listing the selected branches
20. Confirm deletion — verify branches are deleted and the list refreshes
21. Verify a success toast appears

**BRANCH-05 — Feature Branch Purple:**
22. Look at any feature/ branch in the branch list — verify it has a purple/mauve badge labeled "feature"
23. Look at the topology graph — verify feature branches use the same purple/mauve color
24. Verify main branches show blue, develop shows green, release shows peach, hotfix shows red

**BRANCH-06 — Contextual Clone Button:**
25. With a repo open, look at the header toolbar — verify a "Reveal" button with folder icon is visible (NOT "Clone")
26. Click the "Reveal" button — verify the repository directory opens in Finder/Explorer
27. Close the repository — verify the button changes back to "Clone" with fork icon
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if all checks pass, or describe any issues found.</resume-signal>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
All 6 requirements verified via manual testing:
- BRANCH-01: Recent branches section with correct ordering
- BRANCH-02: Pin/unpin with persistence across app restarts
- BRANCH-03: Scope selector with Local/Remote/Last Used filtering
- BRANCH-04: Bulk delete with Gitflow protection and confirmation
- BRANCH-05: Feature branches purple in both topology and branch list
- BRANCH-06: Contextual Reveal button replacing Clone when repo is open
</verification>

<success_criteria>
All 27 verification steps pass. No regressions in existing functionality (branch checkout, merge, create, delete).
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/23-branch-management/23-07-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
