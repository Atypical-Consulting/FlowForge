## Tests

| # | Test | Status | Notes |
|---|------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Blade navigation works — open Settings blade from header | PASS | |
| 2 | Back navigation — return from Settings via back button | PASS | |
| 3 | Blade strip — push multiple blades, click strip to pop back | PASS | |
| 4 | Blade transitions — slide-in/out animations during navigation | PASS | |
| 5 | Error recovery — blade error shows recovery UI (not crash) | PASS | Verified by code inspection (BladeErrorBoundary in place) |
| 6 | Loading states — lazy blades show spinner before rendering | ISSUE | Gitflow Cheatsheet and Repo Browser have no user-accessible entry point — blades registered but unreachable |
| 7 | Diff blade — click file in staging, diff opens with file path title | PASS | |
| 8 | Diff inline toggle — toggle between inline/side-by-side in diff blade | PASS | |

## Issues

### ISSUE-1: No entry point for Gitflow Cheatsheet and Repo Browser blades (Severity: Low)

**Observed**: User cannot open Gitflow Cheatsheet or Repo Browser blades — no button, menu item, or command palette entry exists.
**Expected**: These blades should be reachable through some discoverable UI path.
**Impact**: Low — these are Phase 22 content blades that were registered in 20.1 for infrastructure completeness. The entry points are expected to be wired in Phase 22.

**Note**: This is not strictly a Phase 20.1 regression — Phase 20.1's goal was extensibility infrastructure, not content blade UX. The registrations exist and work; they just lack entry points. Phase 22 (New Content Blades) explicitly covers wiring these up.

**Result**: 7/8 PASS, 1 low-severity issue (deferred to Phase 22)
**Completed**: 2026-02-07
