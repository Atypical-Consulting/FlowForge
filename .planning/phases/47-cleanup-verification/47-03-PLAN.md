<objective>
Create developer documentation (README.md) for the topology extension, the only built-in extension missing one.

Purpose: All 13+ built-in extensions should have consistent developer documentation. Topology is the only one missing a README after phase 46 extraction.
Output: A single README.md following the established convention (see worktrees/README.md, init-repo/README.md).

  <name>Task 1: Create topology extension README.md</name>
  <files>src/extensions/topology/README.md</files>
  <action>
Create `src/extensions/topology/README.md` following the exact convention established by worktrees/README.md and init-repo/README.md.

Content structure:

```markdown
# Topology Graph

Visualize commit history as an interactive lane-based graph with branch classification and commit type icons. Provides the "topology" process tab with lane-based visualization, commit badges, and a file watcher that auto-refreshes the graph when repository files change externally.

## Blades

| Type | Title | Singleton | Lazy | Core Override |
|------|-------|-----------|------|---------------|
| `topology-graph` | Topology | Yes | Yes | Yes |

## Commands

| ID | Title | Category | Shortcut | Description |
|----|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| `show-topology` | Show History | Navigation | `Mod+2` | Switch to the topology (history) view |

## Toolbar Actions

This extension does not contribute any toolbar actions.

## Sidebar Panels

This extension does not contribute any sidebar panels.

## Lifecycle

- **onActivate**: Registers the topology-graph blade (coreOverride), the show-topology command with keyboard shortcut, a file watcher listener for auto-refresh, and applies the defaultTab user setting.
- **onDeactivate**: No-op. Cleanup is handled by `api.cleanup()`. Topology data stays in GitOpsStore (shared core state).
```

Then add the standard Extension Directory Convention section (collapsed `<details>`) matching the worktrees/README.md convention block exactly.

Verify the file structure tree matches the actual files in `src/extensions/topology/` by listing the directory contents. Adjust the tree if any files/directories differ from what is listed above.
  </action>
  <verify>
`cat src/extensions/topology/README.md` exists and contains "Topology Graph", "topology-graph", "show-topology", "File Structure", "Extension Directory Convention".
`ls src/extensions/topology/` confirms the file structure in README matches reality.
  </verify>
  <done>Topology extension has a complete README.md matching the convention used by all other built-in extensions. All 13+ extensions now have READMEs.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. `test -f src/extensions/topology/README.md && echo "EXISTS"` returns EXISTS
2. `grep -c "topology-graph" src/extensions/topology/README.md` returns 2+
3. `grep -c "show-topology" src/extensions/topology/README.md` returns 1+
4. All 13+ extensions have README.md files: `ls src/extensions/*/README.md | wc -l` returns 13+
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- src/extensions/topology/README.md exists with documented file structure, blades, commands, lifecycle
- README follows the exact convention of worktrees/README.md and init-repo/README.md
- Every built-in extension now has a README.md
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/47-cleanup-verification/47-03-SUMMARY.md`
