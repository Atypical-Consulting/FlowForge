## Cross-Phase Integration: 9/9 Flows

| # | Flow | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| 1 | Clone → Open → See topology | COMPLETE |
| 2 | Click commit → Details → Diff | COMPLETE |
| 3 | Branch switch → Topology refresh | COMPLETE |
| 4 | Commit → Toast → Auto-refresh | COMPLETE |
| 5 | Empty repo → Gitflow init → Topology | COMPLETE |
| 6 | Escape key → Blade back navigation | COMPLETE |
| 7 | Settings → defaultRemote respected | COMPLETE |
| 8 | Keyboard shortcut → Tooltip shows | COMPLETE |
| 9 | Amend commit flow | COMPLETE |

### Integration Highlights

- **Toast system** (Phase 11) is used by 27+ call sites across 10+ files
- **Blade navigation** properly implements stack-based push/pop with type-safe blade types
- **Auto-refresh** via event system reliably triggers topology reload after all mutations
- **Monaco DiffEditor** provides professional diff rendering with syntax highlighting

## Tech Debt

### Phase 15: Topology (5 items)

1. **defaultTab setting not wired** — `src/stores/blades.ts:39` hard-codes `activeProcess: "staging"` instead of reading `settings.general.defaultTab`
2. **No EmptyState for empty repos** — Topology shows spinner/blank instead of EmptyState component when repo has zero commits
3. **Spinner vs Skeleton inconsistency** — TopologyPanel uses Loader2 while rest of app uses Skeleton component (Phase 14)
4. **No ShortcutTooltip on blade back** — Escape key works for blade navigation but isn't discoverable via tooltip
5. **Missing SUMMARY/VERIFICATION files** — Phase 15 was executed via direct commits rather than GSD executor, so formal documentation is missing

### General (2 items)

6. **Orphaned v1.0 code** — greet command, getMergeStatus, CollapsibleSidebar, AnimatedList, FadeIn still in codebase
7. **Pre-existing TS2440** — Auto-generated bindings.ts line 1493 has TypeScript error (unrelated to v1.1 work)

**Total:** 7 items across 2 categories. None are blockers.

## Conclusion

v1.1.0 milestone is **complete**. All 34 requirements are satisfied, all 5 phases delivered, and all 9 E2E user flows work correctly. The accumulated tech debt (7 items) consists of polish and cleanup tasks that can be tracked in a future backlog or addressed during the next milestone.
