# Quick Task 38: XState Architecture Exploration

## Mode: Quick (Research Only)
## Description: Explore XState architecture from UX, technical architecture, and expert developer angles with focus on extensibility

---

## Task 1: Multi-Angle XState Architecture Research

**What:** Produce three parallel research analyses exploring the XState architecture refactoring from UX, technical architecture, and expert developer perspectives. Synthesize into a unified strategy document.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] UX-ANALYSIS.md: UX impact assessment for all 5 proposed machines with extensibility implications
- [x] ARCH-ANALYSIS.md: Architecture integration analysis (MachineRegistry, extension boundaries, actor model, type contracts)
- [x] DEV-ANALYSIS.md: Concrete implementation patterns (Tauri IPC wrapping, Channel streaming, React integration, Tailwind v4 state-driven CSS)
- [x] 38-SUMMARY.md: Synthesized strategy with refactoring roadmap

**Approach:** Three parallel research agents (UX researcher, architecture analyst, expert developer) each explore the codebase from their angle, producing independent analyses that are then synthesized.
