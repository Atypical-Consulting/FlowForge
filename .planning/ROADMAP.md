### 🚧 v1.8.0 UI/UX Enhancements (In Progress)

**Milestone Goal:** Elevate FlowForge's user experience with enhanced diff viewing, inline conflict resolution, workspace customization, commit visualization, welcome screen polish, and a Git insights dashboard.

- [x] **Phase 48: Diff Viewer Foundations** — Collapsible regions, word-level highlighting, and preference persistence
- [x] **Phase 49: Inline Conflict Resolution** — Three-way merge view with one-click resolution and manual editing
- [ ] **Phase 50: Hunk & Line Staging** — Stage individual hunks and lines from within the diff viewer
- [ ] **Phase 51: Git Insights Dashboard** — Commit activity charts, contributor breakdown, branch health, and author avatars
- [ ] **Phase 52: Visualization & Welcome Polish** — Commit heat map, node tooltips, pinned repos, health indicators, quick actions
- [ ] **Phase 53: Workspace Layout Presets** — Named layout presets, focus mode, panel toggles, and persistence

## Phase Details

### Phase 48: Diff Viewer Foundations
**Goal**: Users experience a professional-grade diff viewer with collapsed unchanged regions, word-level change highlighting, and persistent view preferences
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase of v1.8.0; builds on existing DiffBlade and InlineDiffViewer)
**Requirements**: DIFF-01, DIFF-04, DIFF-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User opens a diff and sees unchanged code regions collapsed by default, with a "Show N unchanged lines" expander that reveals hidden lines without losing scroll position
  2. User can see word-level (character-level) diff highlighting within changed lines, with distinct colors for additions and deletions in both split and unified view modes
  3. User switches between split and unified diff view modes and that preference persists across app restarts without any additional configuration
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 48-01-PLAN.md — Refactor DiffBlade into composable components + diff preferences slice
- [x] 48-02-PLAN.md — Collapsible regions, word-level highlighting, and theme tuning

### Phase 49: Inline Conflict Resolution
**Goal**: Users can resolve merge conflicts entirely within FlowForge instead of using external merge tools or manually editing conflict markers
**Depends on**: Phase 48 (Monaco pattern improvements and editor disposal established)
**Requirements**: CONF-01, CONF-02, CONF-03, CONF-04, CONF-05
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User sees conflicted files clearly marked with red warning icons in the file tree, a conflict count badge in the toolbar, and can filter to show only conflicts in the staging panel
  2. User can open a conflicted file and see a two-pane diff view (ours vs theirs) with an editable result panel below, all with synchronized scrolling
  3. User can accept "ours", "theirs", or "both" with one click per conflict hunk, and undo any resolution action
  4. User can manually edit the merged result with syntax highlighting and reset to the original conflicted state at any time
  5. User can mark a file as resolved, which stages the file, removes the conflict indicator, and shows a toast confirmation
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 49-01-PLAN.md — Rust backend: conflict.rs with list/read/resolve Tauri commands
- [x] 49-02-PLAN.md — Extension infrastructure: types, store, parser, manifest, App.tsx registration
- [x] 49-03-PLAN.md — Blade UI: ConflictResolutionBlade with diff view, hunk actions, result editor

### Phase 50: Hunk & Line Staging
**Goal**: Users can craft precise commits by staging individual hunks or lines from the diff viewer, replacing the need for command-line `git add -p`
**Depends on**: Phase 49 (Monaco gutter decoration patterns and git2 index operation serialization established)
**Requirements**: DIFF-02, DIFF-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can stage or unstage individual hunks from within the diff viewer via gutter controls, with hunk headers providing clear "Stage hunk" / "Unstage hunk" actions
  2. User can stage or unstage individual lines within a hunk via clickable line controls, with keyboard shortcut support
  3. Staging or unstaging hunks and lines is immediately reflected in the staging panel without requiring a manual refresh
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [ ] 50-01-PLAN.md — Rust backend: enhanced diff types, hunk/line staging commands, error variants, tests
- [ ] 50-02-PLAN.md — Frontend hunk staging: StagingDiffEditor, ViewZone action bars, useHunkStaging hook, CSS
- [ ] 50-03-PLAN.md — Frontend line staging: line selection UI, keyboard shortcuts, partial-stage indicator

### Phase 51: Git Insights Dashboard
**Goal**: Users gain data-driven visibility into repository activity, contributor patterns, and branch health through a built-in analytics dashboard
**Depends on**: Nothing (independent extension; new Rust module + new visx dependency)
**Requirements**: INSI-01, INSI-02, INSI-03, INSI-04, VIZ-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can view a commit activity chart showing daily commit frequency over configurable time ranges (7/30/90 days) with hover details per data point
  2. User can view a contributor breakdown with commit counts and activity percentage, and click a contributor to filter the commit history to that person's commits
  3. User can view a branch health overview listing all branches with last commit date, ahead/behind counts, staleness flags, and quick actions (checkout, delete)
  4. User can view repository stats cards showing total commits, active branches, contributors, and repo age in a responsive grid
  5. User can see author avatars next to commits in history views, fetched from Gravatar with initials fallback and local caching
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 51-01: TBD
- [ ] 51-02: TBD
- [ ] 51-03: TBD

### Phase 52: Visualization & Welcome Polish
**Goal**: Users see a polished, information-rich experience across the topology graph and welcome screen with visual cues for recency, quick access to repositories, and at-a-glance health status
**Depends on**: Phase 51 (AuthorAvatar component created for reuse in topology; insights Rust module provides patterns)
**Requirements**: VIZ-02, VIZ-03, WELC-01, WELC-02, WELC-03
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can toggle a commit heat map where commit nodes in the topology graph are colored by recency, with a legend and respect for prefers-reduced-motion
  2. User can hover over commit nodes in the topology graph and see a tooltip with short hash, author, date, and subject line
  3. User can pin repositories to the top of the welcome screen, with pin state persisting across restarts
  4. User can see repository health indicators on welcome screen cards showing sync status (clean/dirty/behind/ahead) via colored status dots with tooltips
  5. User can perform quick actions on welcome screen repo cards (open, open in terminal, remove from recents) via hover-revealed action buttons
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 52-01: TBD
- [ ] 52-02: TBD
- [ ] 52-03: TBD

### Phase 53: Workspace Layout Presets
**Goal**: Users can instantly switch between purpose-built workspace configurations and have their panel arrangements persist across sessions
**Depends on**: Nothing (pure frontend; independent of other v1.8.0 phases)
**Requirements**: LYOT-01, LYOT-02, LYOT-03, LYOT-04
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. User can select from layout presets (Review, Commit, Explore, Focus) via a toolbar menu, with smooth animated transitions between layouts
  2. User can maximize a single panel to fullscreen via double-click on the panel header, and press Esc to exit focus mode
  3. User can toggle individual panels on/off via a "Panels" menu, with remaining panels redistributing space automatically
  4. User's panel sizes persist across sessions and restore correctly on app launch, with a "Reset to default" option available
**Plans**: TBD

Plans:
- [ ] 53-01: TBD
- [ ] 53-02: TBD
