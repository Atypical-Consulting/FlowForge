- **ADV-03**: Side-by-side diff view
- **ADV-04**: Commit signing (GPG/SSH)
- **ADV-05**: Submodule management

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Built-in code editor | Scope creep, IDE competition — users have editors |
| Issue tracker integration | v1 scope control — focus on Git workflows |
| Mercurial/SVN support | Git-only focus — maintenance burden |
| Plugin/extension system | Complexity, v1 focus — security and stability risks |
| CI/CD integration | v1 scope control — feature creep |
| Built-in terminal | Users have terminals — bloat |
| Code review features | GitHub/GitLab do this well — duplication |
| Real-time collaboration | High complexity — not core to workflow enforcement |
| Mobile apps | Desktop-first — different product |
| OAuth login flows | Not needed for local Git client |
