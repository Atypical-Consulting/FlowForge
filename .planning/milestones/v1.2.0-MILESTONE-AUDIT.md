## Phase Verification Summary

| Phase | Score | Status | Verified |
|-------|-------|--------|----------|
| 16. Quick Fixes & Visual Polish | 7/7 | ✓ Passed | 2026-02-06 |
| 17. Hierarchical View & Commit Enhancements | 10/10 | ✓ Passed | 2026-02-06 |
| 18. Command Palette & Discoverability | 4/4 | ✓ Passed | 2026-02-07 |
| 19. Settings, Onboarding & File Icons | 4/4 | ✓ Passed | 2026-02-07 |

## Cross-Phase Integration

**23/23 exports properly connected. 0 orphaned. 0 broken.**

Key integration points verified:
- Command palette → Settings window (Phase 18 → 19)
- Command palette → Blade reset on repo switch (Phase 18 → 16)
- File type icons → Hierarchical staging tree (Phase 19 → 17)
- Commit type theme → Topology + History + Changelog (Phase 17 → 16)
- Git init → Repository open flow (Phase 19 internal)
- Escape key → Palette takes priority over blade pop (Phase 18 ↔ 16)
- ShortcutTooltip → Toolbar buttons (Phase 18 → all)
- Platform utility → Integrations + Shortcuts (Phase 19 shared)

## E2E Flow Verification

| Flow | Status |
|------|--------|
| New user onboarding (non-git folder → init → repo opens) | ✓ Complete |
| Command palette discovery (open → search → execute) | ✓ Complete |
| Staging workflow (hierarchical → folder stage → colored icons) | ✓ Complete |
| File browsing (diff blade → file icon + formatted header) | ✓ Complete |
| Tag management (create → sorted most recent first) | ✓ Complete |
| Repository switch (toolbar/palette → blade reset → topology reload) | ✓ Complete |

## Tech Debt

### New (from v1.2.0)

1. **closeRepository blade reset** — `closeRepository()` in repository store does not call `resetStack()`. Stale blade content persists in memory after closing a repo. Low impact since WelcomeView hides blade panels, but inconsistent with the repo-switch behavior that does reset.

### Pre-existing (from v1.0/v1.1)

2. **Pre-existing TS2440** — Auto-generated `bindings.ts` has a TypeScript error at line 1493. Not introduced by v1.2.0.
3. **defaultTab not wired** — Blade store initialization hard-codes "staging" tab instead of reading from settings. Pre-existing from v1.1.
4. **Orphaned v1.0 code** — greet command, getMergeStatus, CollapsibleSidebar, AnimatedList, FadeIn components still present.

### Total: 4 items (1 new, 3 pre-existing)

## Integration Quality Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Export Reuse Rate | 100% (23/23) |
| Rust Command Coverage | 100% (6/6 new commands consumed) |
| Cross-Phase Dependencies | 12 verified connections |
| E2E Flow Completeness | 100% (6/6) |
| Code Deduplication | COMMIT_TYPE_THEME shared across 4 consumers |
| Orphaned Code | 0 new (4 pre-existing from v1.0) |

## Conclusion

v1.2.0 milestone is complete. All 19 requirements satisfied across 4 phases with 17 plans executed. Cross-phase integration is excellent — shared modules (commit-type-theme, file-icons, platform utility, command registry) connect cleanly without coupling. All 6 E2E user flows verified end-to-end. One minor tech debt item introduced (closeRepository blade reset); three pre-existing items carried forward.

**Deployment Status: READY**
