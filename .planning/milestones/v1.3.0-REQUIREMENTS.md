### Infrastructure (5/5 complete)

- [x] **INFRA-01**: BladeType union extended with all new blade types (settings, changelog, conventional-commit, viewer-markdown, viewer-3d, repo-browser, gitflow-cheatsheet)
- [x] **INFRA-02**: renderBlade replaced by registry-based BladeRenderer (Phase 20.1 refactor)
- [x] **INFRA-03**: useBladeNavigation provides generic openBlade helper for all blade types (Phase 20.1 refactor)

## Future Requirements (Deferred to v1.4+)

- [ ] Drag-and-drop between Changes and Staged columns
- [ ] Branch pins stored in Git config for portability
- [ ] Per-process blade stack preservation
- [ ] Content Security Policy hardening

## Out of Scope

- Full code review / PR review mode — duplicates GitHub/GitLab; lightweight checklist is sufficient
- Built-in markdown editor — preview only, not editing (scope creep toward IDE)
- Branch comparison/diff blade — better handled on GitHub/GitLab web UI
- General-purpose file explorer — repo file browser is commit/HEAD-scoped, not a system file manager
- Auto-archive stale branches — too aggressive; manual cleanup with suggestions is safer
