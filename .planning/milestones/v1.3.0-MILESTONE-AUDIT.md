# v1.3.0 Milestone Audit: Blades Blades Blades

**Audited:** 2026-02-08
**Status:** TECH DEBT (all requirements met, no blockers, accumulated debt needs review)

---

## 1. Milestone Scope

**Milestone:** v1.3.0 — Blades Blades Blades
**Phases:** 6 (20, 20.1, 21, 22, 23, 24)
**Requirements:** 25 across 5 categories (Blade Migrations, New Content Blades, Branch Management, UX Improvements, Infrastructure)

**Definition of Done (from ROADMAP.md):**
> v1.3.0 expands the blade navigation system into FlowForge's primary interaction model. Modals are migrated to blades, new content blades add rich file previews (markdown, 3D models, repo browser, Gitflow reference), staging gets a two-column layout, and branch management gains quick-access features and bulk cleanup. The milestone delivers 7 new blade types, removes 3 modal dialogs, and adds 4 lazy-loaded production dependencies while keeping startup impact at zero.

## 2. Phase Verification Summary

| Phase | Name | Verification Source | Status | Score |
|-------|------|-------------------|--------|-------|
| 20 | Blade Infrastructure & Modal Migration | Implicit (Phase 20.1 built on top) | PASSED | N/A (no formal artifact) |
| 20.1 | Blade Extensibility Refactoring | 20.1-VERIFICATION.md | PASSED | 6/6 |
| 21 | Two-Column Staging & Inline Diff | 21-UAT.md | PASSED | 15/15 |

## 4. Cross-Phase Integration

| Integration Point | Status | Evidence |
|-------------------|--------|----------|
| Blade registry covers all 13 blade types | ✓ Wired | `registrations/index.ts` barrel imports all 13 |
| Repo browser dispatches to correct viewer blade per file type | ✓ Wired | `fileDispatch.ts` → markdown/3d/image/code/nupkg viewers |
| Staging inline diff expands to full-screen diff blade | ✓ Wired | StagingDiffPreview → openDiff → DiffBlade |
| Settings blade includes Review tab from Phase 24 | ✓ Wired | SettingsBlade.tsx imports ReviewSettings |
| Review checklist appears in FinishFlowDialog | ✓ Wired | FinishFlowDialog imports ReviewChecklist |
| Gitflow operations trigger branch list refresh | ✓ Wired | gitflow.ts calls loadBranches + refreshStatus after all operations |
| Feature branch purple coloring in topology + branch list | ✓ Wired | branchClassifier.ts single source of truth |
| Branch metadata store initializes on repo open | ✓ Wired | App.tsx calls initBranchMetadata |
| Review checklist store initializes on app mount | ✓ Wired | App.tsx calls initChecklist |

## 6. Tech Debt Summary

### Missing Verification Artifacts (Non-blocking)

| Phase | Missing | Mitigation |
|-------|---------|------------|
| 20 | VERIFICATION.md + SUMMARY.md files | Phase 20.1 verified and refactored Phase 20's output; all 9 requirements marked complete |
| 21 | VERIFICATION.md | UAT passed 15/15 tests |
| 23 | VERIFICATION.md | UAT summary (23-07-SUMMARY.md) passed 6/6 requirements |

### Accumulated Tech Debt (10 items across 6 categories)

1. **3D viewer reliability** — Viewer3dBlade may fail on some hardware; diagnostic logging added but root cause unresolved
2. **Debug page in production** — `public/debug/viewer3d-test.html` (823 lines) ships in prod bundle
3. **Gitflow cheatsheet discoverability** — Not in command palette (only accessible via header icon)
4. **Review store error handling** — console.error only, no user-facing notification on persistence failure
5. **Pre-existing bindings.ts TS2440** — Auto-generated, unrelated to v1.3.0
6. **closeRepository() doesn't reset blade stack** — Stale blade content in memory after close (from v1.2.0)
7. **defaultTab setting not wired** — Hard-coded to "staging" (from v1.2.0)
8. **Topology lacks EmptyState** — For repos with zero commits (from v1.2.0)
9. **Orphaned v1.0 code** — greet command, getMergeStatus, CollapsibleSidebar, AnimatedList, FadeIn
10. **Missing formal verification docs** — 3 phases lack VERIFICATION.md (mitigated by UAT evidence)

**None of these are blockers.** Items 5-9 are pre-existing from prior milestones.

## 7. Milestone Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Phases | 6 |
| Plans executed | ~50 (8 + 6 + 5 + 26 + 7 + 4) |
| Requirements delivered | 25/25 (100%) |
| Blade types added | 7 new (settings, changelog, viewer-markdown, viewer-3d, repo-browser, gitflow-cheatsheet, conventional-commit) |
| Blade types total | 13 |
| Modals removed | 3 (SettingsWindow, ChangelogDialog, ConventionalCommitModal) |
| UAT rounds | 4+ (Phases 21, 22, 23, 24) |
| Gap closure waves | 10 (Phase 22 alone) |

---

## 8. Verdict

**STATUS: TECH DEBT** — All 25 requirements satisfied. No critical blockers. Cross-phase integration verified. E2E flows complete. Accumulated tech debt (10 items) needs review before or during next milestone.

**Recommendation:** Proceed to milestone completion. Track tech debt items 1-4 (v1.3.0-specific) in next milestone backlog. Items 5-9 are pre-existing and should be addressed in a dedicated cleanup phase.
