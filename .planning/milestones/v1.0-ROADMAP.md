# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-02-04
**Phases:** 1-8 (+ 6.1, 6.2 inserted)
**Total Plans:** 53

## Overview

FlowForge delivers a cross-platform Git client in 8 phases: starting with Tauri scaffolding and repository management, building core staging/commit/sync operations, adding branch management, implementing the Gitflow state machine for workflow enforcement, visualizing topology with Gitflow lanes, adding conventional commit tooling, implementing worktree management, and finishing with UX polish and performance optimization. Each phase builds on the previous, with the Gitflow state machine (Phase 4) being the core differentiator that elevates basic Git operations into enforced workflow.

## Phases

## Milestone Summary

**Decimal Phases:**
- Phase 6.1: Catppuccin Mocha File Icons (inserted after Phase 6 for visual polish)
- Phase 6.2: UX/UI Enhancements (inserted after Phase 6.1 for comprehensive UX upgrade)

**Key Decisions:**
- Tauri over Electron (performance, binary size)
- git2-rs over shell-out (performance, type safety)
- tauri-specta for IPC (type-safe bindings)
- React Flow + dagre for topology (standard visualization)
- Catppuccin for theming (modern, cohesive palette)
- Zustand + React Query for state (simple, powerful)

**Issues Resolved:**
- IPC serialization performance via pagination
- spawn_blocking for all git2-rs calls
- Arc<Mutex<Repository>> for thread safety
- Cross-platform paths with PathBuf

**Issues Deferred:**
- Topology auto-refresh (tech debt for v1.1)
- Orphaned code cleanup (tech debt for v1.1)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- Topology graph requires manual tab switch to refresh after commits
- Unused components: CollapsibleSidebar, AnimatedList, FadeIn
- Unused commands: greet, getMergeStatus
