- 43 Tauri commands registered
- 41 commands have frontend callers

### E2E Flows

| Flow | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Repository → Staging → Commit → Push | ✓ COMPLETE | Full flow works |
| Conventional Commit Composer | ✓ COMPLETE | Type, scope, validation wired |
| Branch → Gitflow → Topology | ✓ COMPLETE | Colors by branch type |
| Worktree → Repository Context Switch | ✓ COMPLETE | Dynamic import works |
| Theme Toggle → All Components | ✓ COMPLETE | Mocha/Latte throughout |
| Keyboard Shortcuts → Operations | ✓ COMPLETE | Cmd+O, Cmd+Shift+A/P/L/F |
| File Watcher → UI Refresh | ✓ COMPLETE | Events trigger query invalidation |
| Commit/Branch → Topology Refresh | ⚠ PARTIAL | Manual tab switch needed |

## Tech Debt

### Phase 5: Topology Visualization
- Topology graph not auto-refreshed when commits happen
- Topology not included in global refresh button (Header.tsx handleRefreshAll)

**Impact:** Minor UX issue - users may see stale topology until tab switch
**Recommendation:** Add topology invalidation to file watcher and refresh button

### Orphaned Code
- `greet` command - Tauri hello world stub, never called
- `getMergeStatus` command - defined but no UI uses it
- `CollapsibleSidebar` component - exported, never imported
- `AnimatedList` component - exported, never imported
- `FadeIn` component - exported, never imported

**Impact:** Dead code in bundle
**Recommendation:** Remove or wire in v1.1

## Conclusion

**Milestone v1.0 is ready for completion.**

All 58 requirements are satisfied. All 10 phases are complete. The tech debt identified (topology refresh, orphaned code) does not block user functionality - the app works correctly, with topology requiring manual refresh after commits.

### Recommended Actions

1. **Accept tech debt** and complete milestone now
2. **Track for v1.1:** Add topology auto-refresh, clean up orphaned code
