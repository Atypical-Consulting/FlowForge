# Branch Management

FlowForge makes it easy to work with branches through a visual interface that supports both local and remote operations.

## Viewing Branches

The Branches panel lists local and remote branches, grouped by scope. Toggle between **Local**, **Remote**, and **All** views using the scope selector. The current branch is highlighted and shown in the header.

## Creating a Branch

Click **New Branch** in the toolbar, enter a name, and optionally choose a starting point. FlowForge creates the branch and checks it out in one step.

## Checking Out

Double-click a branch or select it and press **Enter** to check it out. If you have uncommitted changes, FlowForge warns you before switching.

## Merging

Right-click a branch to access the merge option. FlowForge performs the merge and reports the result. If conflicts occur, the Changes panel highlights the conflicting files so you can resolve them.

## Deleting Branches

Select a branch and click **Delete** to remove it. FlowForge prevents deleting the currently checked-out branch and asks for confirmation before deleting branches that have not been merged.

## Pinned & Recent Branches

Pin frequently used branches for quick access — they appear at the top of the branch list. FlowForge also tracks your recently visited branches so you can switch back without scrolling.

## Remote Operations

Push a local branch to a remote, or delete a remote tracking branch, directly from the branch context menu. Fetch and pull operations keep your remote branch list up to date.
