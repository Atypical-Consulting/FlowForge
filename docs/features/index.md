# Features

FlowForge brings together the tools you need for daily Git work in a single native application.

## Core Capabilities

### Gitflow Workflow
Start, finish, and manage **feature**, **release**, and **hotfix** branches through a guided interface. FlowForge handles the merge strategy and tag creation automatically. [Learn more &rarr;](/features/gitflow)

### Staging & Commits
View file diffs, stage individual files or hunks, write commit messages, and amend previous commits — all from a unified panel. [Learn more &rarr;](/features/staging)

### Branch Management
Create, checkout, rename, merge, and delete branches. Pin frequently used branches and track recent activity. [Learn more &rarr;](/features/branches)

### Commit Topology
Visualize your repository's commit graph in an interactive node-based view. Select commits to inspect details, navigate history, and understand branch relationships at a glance.

### Push, Pull & Fetch
Sync with remotes using dedicated toolbar actions or keyboard shortcuts. Progress indicators keep you informed during network operations.

### Stash Support
Save and restore work-in-progress changes with Git stash. Name your stashes for easy identification and apply or drop them as needed.

### Repository Initialization
Create new Git repositories from any folder with guided `.gitignore` template selection, project type auto-detection, and optional initial commit generation. [Learn more &rarr;](/features/init-repo)

### Conventional Commits
Write structured commit messages with a dedicated editor that breaks messages into type, scope, description, and body fields. Live preview ensures correct formatting before you commit. [Learn more &rarr;](/features/conventional-commits)

### Review Checklist
Before finishing a Gitflow branch, an advisory checklist reminds you of common pre-merge steps. Items are customizable per flow type in Settings.
